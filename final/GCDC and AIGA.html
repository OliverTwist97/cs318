        <p>
            One of GCDC's goals is to cement a healthy design community
            within UWEC. We want to be able to extend opportunities to our
            members and artists on campus in general such as group
            portfolio reviews and acknowledging potential job or internship
            opportunities to better prepare us for our futures. To assist us
            with our goal, GCDC has formed a student group with AIGA.
            
        
        <p>
            The American Institute of Graphic Arts, or AIGA, is a nationally recognized
            organization for designers across the country. Along with job
            postings and internship opportunities, AIGA is a hub for all types
            of designers both professional and up-and-coming. Through the 
            use of student groups, GCDC has the opportunity to go to AIGA
            conferences in Minneapolis, MN such as portfolio/resume reviews 
            to help mold our future career decisions.
