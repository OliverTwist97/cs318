        <p>GCDC helps encourage those interested in Graphic Design to
           create art that best expresses themselves and their interests.
           With members ranging from all types of majors/minors and 
           different standings in school, we emphasize the ability to let your
           creativity flourish. Along with teaching members Adobe
           programs to create Graphic Art, we also critique our works to 
           help ourselves become better artists with the help of our peers.
           No one at GCDC is here to put others down or compete with
           each other. GCDC is a collective community that strives to see
           all members enjoy and be proud of what they create. 
           
           Below are works created by our members who gave consent to
           their work being put up on the website.
